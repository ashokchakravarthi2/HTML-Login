Certainly! Let's break down the HTML and CSS code into simpler terms:

### HTML Part:
- **Document Type Declaration (DOCTYPE):**
  - `<!DOCTYPE html>` declares that the document is an HTML5 document.

- **HTML Document Structure:**
  - `<html lang="en">`: Defines the HTML document with the language set to English.
  - `<head>`: Contains metadata about the document, like character set and viewport settings.
  - `<title>`: Specifies the title of the webpage.
  - `<link>`: Links an external CSS file to apply styles.
  - `<body>`: Contains the content of the webpage.

- **Main Container (`<div class="container">`):**
  - Acts as a container for the entire content.

- **Company Name (`<h1 class="company-name">VISION</h1>`):**
  - Displays the company name "VISION" with a specific styling.

- **Image Container (`<div class="image-container">`):**
  - Contains two images side by side.

- **Sign-In Form (`<form id="login-form" class="active">`):**
  - A form for users to sign in with a username and password.
  - Includes a "Forgot Password" link.

- **Sign-Up Form (`<form id="register-form">`):**
  - A form for users to sign up with various fields like full name, email, etc.

- **Company Information (`<div class="company-info">`):**
  - Provides information about the company's address and email.

- **JavaScript File Inclusion (`<script src="path-to-your-script.js"></script>`):**
  - Links an external JavaScript file for additional functionality (e.g., toggling between sign-in and sign-up forms).

### CSS Part (`styles.css`):
- **Styling for Body and Container:**
  - Sets background images for the webpage.
  - Styles the main container with a maximum width, margin, padding, background overlay, and box shadow.

- **Styling for Company Name (`h1` and `.company-name`):**
  - Centers the text, adjusts the margin, and sets the text color.

- **Styling for Forms and Components:**
  - Styles the forms to have a flexible column layout.
  - Adds styles to social media links, username-password input fields, and submit buttons.

- **Styling for Hover Effects:**
  - Defines color changes when hovering over certain elements.

- **Styling for "Not a Member?" Section:**
  - Centers the text and sets styles for links.

- **Styling for Register Form and Active Form:**
  - Initially hides the register form and displays it when it's active.

- **Styling for Company Information:**
  - Adjusts the margin and color of company address and email.

These styles and structures collectively create a simple sign-in/sign-up webpage for a company named "VISION." Users can toggle between signing in and signing up, and the page has a visually appealing layout with background images and clean styling.
